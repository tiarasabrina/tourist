  <h1>Hiking Trails in Singapore</h1>

<h2>Strap on a pair of good shoes and get in touch with nature at these green hiking trails</h2>

  <h1>The Rail Corridor</h1>

<p>How far? The Rail Corridor covers about 24km, but the central stretch, which recently reopened, is about 4km-long.

How long will it take? Depends on the route you choose as there are many things to do and see along the way.

Why go? Besides its lush natural landscapes, the Rail Corridor is also known for its rich heritage. The railway line was used for commuting and transporting goods between Singapore and Malaysia from the beginning of the 20th century until 2011. And now it has been enhanced for easy access. Look forward to the sensitive restoration of landmarks like the Bukit Timah Railway Station and two steel truss railway bridges, lookout decks to soak up nature’s beauty, and paths to immerse in the rainforest experience.

What's there to see? Besides the Bukit Timah Railway Station and the truss railway bridges, you can also head to the nearby Singapore Quarry where you can spot rare birds, fishes, turtles and even monitor lizards if you're sharp. For more wildlife, trek down to Dairy Farm Nature Park, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and Hindhede Nature Park.</p>

<h1>Macritchie Reservoir</h1>

<p>How far? To get into the rainforest proper, the MacRitchie Trails offer both easy boardwalk treks and ambitious hikes that can be as long as 11km.

How long will it take? Depends on the trail you choose!

Why go? Singapore’s oldest and most popular nature park is a haven for joggers, families and weekend strollers. The highlight is the HSBC TreeTop Walk, a suspension bridge positioned 25m above the forest floor, which connects the two highest points in the reserve and offers splendid panoramic views. Traffic on the bridge is one-way, so there’s literally no turning back.

What's there to see? Wildlife – from flying lemurs to tree frogs and pangolins – is abundant but rarely seen. Long-tailed macaque monkeys are more common, but be wary: they can be quite ferocious, as they’re used to being fed by irresponsible visitors.</p>

<h1>Alexandra Woodland</h1>

<p>How far? The Alexandra Woodland is a small patch of wilderness which lies next to the Rail Corridor, opposite Alexandra Hospital and next to the Ayer Rajah Expressway. Start the trek from Portsdown Avenue and stick close to the main path to get there. 

How long will it take? Exploring the area will take less than an hour.

Why go? It's so beautifully hidden and a pocket of peace from the busy Rail Corridor. Stick around for the pictures you can take of the place. 

What's there to see? The main attraction of this trail is the magnificent 'Lost Ark' structure made from giant fallen trees next to a natural pond. As it is an off-trail location, do hike at your own risk – always wear proper attire and walking shoes, and let someone know where you are. Most importantly, do respect the surroundings and leave as you found it and do be mindful of tramping on young plants and saplings.</p>
