  <h3>What’s there to do in Sentosa? Isn’t it just a small island?

Yes, it is. In fact, the island is just slightly under 5 square kilometers. If you’re a first-time visitor to Singapore, I couldn’t recommend visiting Sentosa highly enough. If you have visited Sentosa before, well, it’s so hard to tell your friends you’ve seen it all because the island keeps adding new things all the time, it’s so annoying.

Is Sentosa worth visiting? Yes. Well, I’m obviously biased. I visited Sentosa the first time about 17 years ago and fell in love with it. To this day, I’m still loving it. They say love is blind and biased.</h3>

<h1>Adventure Cove Waterpark</h1>

<p>Adventure Cove Waterpark is a really cool water theme park that has all of the conventional fixtures, such as Lazy River, Wave Pool, water slides PLUS snorkeling.</p>

Yes, you read that right, you can enjoy unlimited snorkel in a giant pool full of colorful fishes. If you love water, I highly recommend spending a day at Adventure Cove.

<h1>S.E.A Aquarium</h1>

<p>At S.E.A. Aquarium, you can expect to meet about 100,000 marine animals of over 800 species. How cool is that! Some marine animals you will encounter include hammerhead shark, manta ray, giant Pacific octopus and dolphin!

If you fancy walking inside the aquarium but you don’t have a diving certificate, try Sea Trek Adventure. The SGO is envisioned as a first-class centre for marine biodiversity education and research, conservation and restoration of vulnerable marine organisms and habitats.

"It aims to inspire change and drive action to protect the oceans through the experiences it offers," RWS said.

The content it offers will be larger in scale and depth than the S.E.A. Aquarium and will be enhanced through "state-of-the-art digital innovation and interactive technology".</p>
