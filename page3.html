  <p>Housed in a beautifully restored colonial building from 1887, the iconic Raffles Hotel provides a relaxing getaway in the heart of the city.

The hotel boasts beautiful interiors with antique furnishings, fine oriental carpets, and teak wood flooring. In addition to the six existing suite categories, the revitalised hotel offers three new ones: Residence, Promenade, and Studio Suites. 

The luxurious hotel boasts a choice of 14 dining options – including BBR by Alain Ducasse and the Raffles Courtyard –and a shopping arcade, outfitted with a charming Raffles Boutique and various retail brands such as Leica, Rimowa, and The Hour Glass.

  <p>Towering over the sparkling Marina Bay, Mandarin Oriental, Singapore needs no introduction. The hotel, after all, has been an iconic presence amidst the city skyline since it opened in 1987. The building itself is an architectural masterpiece, with its structure resembling a fan, a nod to the hotel brand’s logo. Swing through the glass doors on Raffles Avenue and you’ll be greeted by an impressive atrium-style lobby, the brainchild of American architect John Portman.

The guest rooms are the epitome of modern sophistication, outfitted with plush patterned carpets and wood-panelled walls. The interiors feature oriental influences and motifs combined with sprawling views of the city, bay or ocean. Soak up the views from the private balcony of the Premier Room, spend quality time with a small group of friends in the one-bedroom City Suite. 


A hallmark of Mandarin Oriental, Singapore is the stunning 25-metre outdoor pool, a city oasis surrounded by lush gardens and private cabanas. It’s the perfect place to swim laps or enjoy a peaceful dip while gazing out at spectacular views of the Marina Bay. The Spa at Mandarin Oriental Singapore, located adjacent to the pool, draws inspiration from Singapore’s rich past to create a sanctuary offering a range of indulgent treatments.</p>
