  <h3>Get ready to indulge in all the best rides Singapore has to offer!</h3>
  <p>Universal Studios Singapore is a theme park located within the Resorts World Sentosa at Sentosa, Singapore. It features 28 rides, shows, and attractions in seven themed zones. It is one of the six Universal Studios theme parks around the world. Here are some of our favourite rides there.</p>

  <h2>Battlestar Galactica</h2>

  <p>No matter how many planes you’ve flown on, your heart rate will always double at the mention of turbulence. But ‘technical glitches’ found on a rollercoaster – one that zooms at 90km/h, twists, turns and propels you over 14 storeys into the air (‘Human’) – takes that fear factor to a whole new level. Especially when the second track, where shoulder straps provide a (false?) sense of security, turns 360 degrees a couple of times and has your legs dangling in mid-air. Riding on ‘Human’ feels like you’re being thrown into the skies. According to one TOS staffer: ‘You will die!’. While said in jest, the recent closing-for-repair of the ride makes a few minor bumps on board sound like a walk in the park. Tip: don’t wear flip-flops or strapless sandals; do leave your belongings behind; and hold on tight, really tight.</p>

  <h2>Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure</h2>

  <p>This is meant to be a scary ride. It’s not. Instead, it whirls along – there are no paddles to control the circular tub – to the ebb and flow of a powerful water current that tosses your raft into blind corners where predatory dinosaurs have been positioned, jaws open. Fun to the point of being silly, in this adventure the reptiles look fake when you and your companions should be screaming at the top of your lungs. The coup de grâce is when your raft rides a cage lift and you look above and see a giant dinosaur about to bite your head off. Then the door opens and you get thrown one storey down. Fun! Tip: bring extra clothes or rent a poncho ($1.50): you will definitely emerge dripping wet.</p>

  <h2>Revenge of the Mummy</h2>

  <p>The indoor rollercoaster-slash-ghost train travels through a pitch-dark room and has enough surprises to scare the bejesus out of you – flying (fake, of course) mummies and insects, water splashes (real), and a live flame that bursts suddenly on top of your head. The ride is filled with the kind of special effects that make you feel you’re part of a psychological thriller. Tip: there’s a minute’s unnecessary walk through mazes before you reach the ride. Once you get to the pick-up point, grab the front seat and guess when the ride’s about to make the biggest and fastest descent.</p>
